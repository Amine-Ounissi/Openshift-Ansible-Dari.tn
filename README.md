# Integration Project: Dari.tn 

## Phase 3: Software deployment environment

Our project should include solutions to provide the deployment environment
required to run the web application. Since each client will have his own instance of the
application, resource optimization, greater efficiency and reducing overhead should be taken
into consideration. Portability also should be ensured since it will be possible to deploy the
application easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms.
Centralized management and orchestration for all the deployment environments have to be
provided too. It will simplify the management of all the application instances and,
simultaneously, to make it more efficient. This orchestration solution should:
● Installable only on CentOS or RHEL platforms.
● Installable automatically using configuration management Tools
● Providing default strict security policies
● Providing mechanisms that makes integration with external authentication systems like
Active Directory easy.
● Including tools for building and managing container images without having to use external
tools.
